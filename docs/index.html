		<h1>Tom Lioy</h1>
		<p>I am a BFA illustration student on my last semester here at Oswego. I am from the Rochester area, so the drastic weather change is no stranger to me. Not sure what I want to do after school, I know I would like to freelance, but I also want to work for a company instead of trying to figure out the illustration field and go through a lot of trial and error.</p>
